        <P> <h3>We are creating this website to solve the major problem of manual tracking and capturing working activities of farmers and also to keep the record of their attendance. <br>
        Manual attendance is a bit burdensome due to a wide number of people. <br>
        <br>
    Our main aim is to build a system which can mark attendance of many people at a time or within a single capture to spot. </h3> </P>
